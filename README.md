Experimental Learning Curve.

Trying to learn some of the best libraries, design pattern and ideas and implementing as we go.

Basic structures are absorbed and shamelessly copied from mostly the awesome repository by Google:
https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture

specially from these branches:
https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture/tree/todo-mvp/
https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture/tree/todo-mvp-dagger/

These branches seperately demonstrate each features. There are some nice forks which combines all of them together, like this one:
https://github.com/clickxu/android-architecture

There is an alternative approach - "Clean":
https://fernandocejas.com/2014/09/03/architecting-android-the-clean-way/
His repository is : https://github.com/android10/Android-CleanArchitecture

And this one also demonstrates Clean: https://github.com/glomadrian/MvpCleanArchitecture

The above two are going over the head now. So for now these are respectfully kept aside.just cloned to sometimes look at and get brain damage.


So for now simply following the google sample and its fork and also this one:

https://github.com/ribot/android-boilerplate
